# CoffeeRunMk2 CPSC 473
# Updated coffeenrun to work with deployd back-end

IMPORTANT: My pending orders area does not show orders that are pending (even if they are in deployd).
  I have tried to figure out why, going so far as to redo chapters 10 and 11 with no luck. Despite that,
  I did my best to implement the functionality we were supposed to for this project.
  
  Additionally, I did not upload the Webshims directory for Mac OSX Safari because there were many files
  in there and Github doesn't allow me to upload more then 100 files at once.
